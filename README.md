# Cluster_Basketball_Players_By_Season

This project aims to see how players change clusters on a year-by-year basis.

# Data Processing

The data is taken from player pages from basketball reference, where we can get a variety of statistics, such as per-game, per 100 possessions, and advanced shooting statistics. The data is presented in a table form, but it is buried in HTML code. Python packages such as Beautiful Soup and Requests were required to gather the data needed. After getting access to the data, only minor data cleaning data was needed to get the data to a usable form.

Furthermore, in order for above to work, there needs to be a list of links to players. I obtained this by going through the player directories and grabbing links of players that fit into the range of years that I want (end of 2013 to end of 2020).
